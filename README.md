# Snake-Game

This the re-make of the classic snake game made of the very first cellular phones.

SETUP : The snake is a series of "nodes" which move on a 2D plane. The nodes follow
the path taken by the head. The snake "eats" the insects to grow in size. Growing is
the abstraction of adding nodes to the body of the snake.

GOAL : Get the maximum "points", by adding as many nodes as possible without hitting
the snake's own body.

FAILURE STATE : When the snake hits one of its own nodes or hits a "wall", the game is
over.

IDEAS USED : Linked Lists, Event Listeners, List traversal
